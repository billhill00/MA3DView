MA3DView is an application to review a 3D voxel image, adjust the grey-level
histogram and to crop the volume. Typically it wass used as part of the
normalising process for Optical Project Tomography (OPT) images which may
need grey-level re-mapping. The application uses Motif and is known to build
on Linux and OSX systems.
